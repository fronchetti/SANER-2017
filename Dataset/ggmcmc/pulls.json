You already had the import statement in place, so it should have no impact.  The CRAN people love to import vs. depend.\n\nQuick note: \n- checking examples ... OK\n  Examples with CPU or elapsed time > 5s\n         user system elapsed\n  ggs_pairs 8.917  0.163   9.420\n\nThe example takes longer than 5 seconds. If it's just one, they might let it slide, but they get mad at me. :-/ .  To get around this, I store the plotmatrix to a variable, then I comment the variable on the next line. \n\nHope this helps!\n\nBest,\nBarret\n",

I tested it with single models and lists and everything seems to be working fine. I added a few tests in the function to make sure it doesn't break.\n\nOne thing I did notice. If you write a ggs object to file and then read it and try to use the cater plot function it fails because of `attributes(D)$parallel` since the write out (at least to csv) removes this attribute. You could just make parallel default to false perhaps? \n\nAlso, the file for the cater function has caterpillar spelled with only one 'l'.\n\nCheerio!\n",
