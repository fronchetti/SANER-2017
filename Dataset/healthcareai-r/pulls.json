        "body": "The goal of this pull request is to expand the intervention recommendation functionality to continuous variables. It also provides more control over the recommendations for categorical variables.\r\n\r\nNew changes:\r\n\r\n- Added `variableLevels` parameter to `getProcessVariablesDf()`. By setting this parameter, the user can both (1) restrict the possible recommendations for categorical variables (e.g. never recommend smoking) and (2) get recommendations for continuous variables by providing explicit baselines (e.g. compare current systolic blood pressure to baselines of 120 and 140). \r\n- Added examples to the random forest and lasso deployment documentation. I decided to add new examples rather than add to the existing examples in order to easily illustrate the different `getProcessVariablesDf()` parameters all in one place. The lasso example is a little weird because only one variable (`A1CNBR`) has a non-zero coefficient.\r\n\r\nAs it's written, the user always needs to include all modifiable variables the `modifiableVariables`, even if those variables are present in the `variableLevels` list. Let me know if the repetition seems to cumbersome and I can try and change that.",

All my changes are in ` test-get-process-variables-df.R`.\r\n\r\nMost of the new tests involve checking that the various arguments to `getProcessVariablesDf` behave as they should, e.g.:\r\n- `smallerBetter` determines the order of the factors\r\n- `numTopFactors` changes the number of modifiable factors listed\r\n- `repeatedFactors` toggles whether a given variable can be listed more than once\r\n- it is possible to select rows by grain column using `grainColumnIDs`\r\n\r\nLet me know if you think of other things that need to be tested. Otherwise, after these unit tests are added, it might be time to merge limone into the package and see if Joe can break it.\r\n",

In `build_process_variable_df_list`, I build a large dataframe and, at the very end, split it into a list of many small dataframes which I then feed to `build_process_variables_df`. I suspect there's a better way to achieve the same outcome.\r\n- Suggestions for making this as easy as possible to integrate with the refactoring.\r\n- Simplifying long cumbersome variable and function names such as\r\n  - `build_process_variable_df_list`\r\n  - `permute_process_variables`\r\n  - `modifiable_variable_levels`\r\n  - `low_probabilities_desired`",

If the model types don't match, throws an error. If the predictedCol names don't match, throws a warning. Uses the saved predictedCol and grainCol to better determine which columns should be present in deploy.\r\n- Updated and added unit tests.",

I can make it return a data frame, but the name of the columns gets lost in the process anyways. I couldn't come up with a fix for this.\r\n\r\nOne assumption I made is that all DTS columns have only DTS as the suffix. I didn't check for dts or Dts or anything.

        "body": "When there are many rare factor levels (more than 5 for a single variable), the warning will now print the number of rare factor levels for each factor variable rather than a full list of names. I also removed the sentence explaining that rare factor levels might not be used in training since I suspect that it would lead to more confusion than enlightenment. The warning for factor levels which are not used in training the model still lists all levels regardless of how many there are.\r\n\r\nFor example, compare the following:\r\n\r\nOld warnings:\r\n```\r\nWarning messages:\r\n1: In private$loadData() :\r\n  Each of the following categorical variable levels occurs 3 times or fewer:\r\n-  fruit : c(\"apricot\", \"cherry\", \"currant\", \"grape\", \"guava\", \"kiwi\", \"lime\", \"loops\", \"lychee\", \"nectarine\", \"orange\", \"papaya\", \"peach\", \"pineapple\")\r\n-  num : c(\"1\", \"11\", \"12\", \"14\", \"16\", \"17\", \"18\", \"19\", \"21\", \"22\", \"23\", \"24\", \"27\", \"28\", \"29\", \"3\", \"30\", \"31\", \"34\", \"35\", \"36\", \"37\", \"38\", \"4\", \"40\", \"41\", \"42\", \"43\", \"44\", \"46\", \"48\", \"50\", \"6\", \"8\", \"9\")\r\nThere is a chance that the model will not train on all of them.

Please review for:\r\n- Does each document make sense?\r\n- Do you want to change any formatting?\r\n- Are there typos?\r\nThis isn't an ideal solution as we have a lot of repeated code in 8 places. However, it conveys the information for now in 2.0 and we can think about docs more carefully for 3.0 \ud83d\ude3a. \r\n\r\nNote that you must build and reload after switching into my branch to see the new docs files in my branch in RStudio.",

This has been fixed. As a result, many unit test values changed.\r\n- `SupervisedModelDevelopment` was previously only removing rows with NA in the target during training. With the target no longer being imputed, we had to do the same for test data, as it would break the performance metric stuff otherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

I tried to compromise between avoiding lots of repeated code and tests being self contained (see #402) doing all the model development in the setup and all of the model deployment (including creating the new deploy sets) in the individual tests. \r\n\r\nWhile writing the tests, I ran into a few bugs which I tried to fix.  Changes to the code include\r\n- Assigning factor levels after imputing new factor levels\r\n- Assigning factor levels before performing predictions for random forest and LMM\r\n\r\nI ran the tests and examples and did a CRAN check, all of which passed (or at least as well as they do for master).",

        "body": "**Lengthy intro**\r\n\r\nI first want to set out some terminology to avoid confusion.  I'm going to use *developset* to denote the data we feed into SupervisedModelDevelopment and *deployset* to denote the data we feed into SupervisedModelDeployment.  In development, a train/test split is performed on the developset: I'll refer to the resulting sets as the *trainset* and *testset*.  In particular, I want to distinguish between the testset which comes from the developset and the deployset which is new data.  I'll also use factor to refer to a categorical variable and factor level to refer to a value that categorical variable can take.\r\n\r\nThe main issue this pull request set out to resolve deals with problems associated with an edge case when there are factors with factor levels which occur very infrequently.\r\n\r\nThe edge case is as follows: if there are several factor levels which occur relatively infrequently, then there may be factor levels which are present in the developset but **not** in the trainset.  The problem that was occuring was that the factor levels from the developset were saved with the model, but the fitLogit was being trained on the trainset and so was a mismatch between the number of variables and coefficients when calculating top factors.\r\n\r\nTaylor and Taylor and I talked about dealing with new factor levels which appear in the deployset.  We agreed that (1) these variables should not be used in training the model since the model has no information on how they affect the outcome but (2) in many cases, we will still want to make a prediction (a prediction with incomplete information is better than no prediction at all) and therefore (3) we should impute these values, but deliver the predictions with a warning about the imputation.\r\n\r\nThe problem arising with the edge case is subtly different: here, there are factor levels which do appear in the developset, but just aren't making it into the trainset.  Even though the trained model has no information on how these factor levels affect the outcome, I don't think they should be treated the same way as new factor levels in the deployset (in particular, it would be strange if these new factor levels appear in the deployset and the user gets a warning that the model has never seen these levels before, despite the fact that they occured in the developset).\r\n\r\nI had a good discussion with Levi, Ethan, Hanlei, and Shufang, where we decided that this issue will probably occur very rarely and that the best way to solve this issue is through impact coding or cross-validation.  In the meantime, it seems reasonable to just warn the user that their data is potentially problematic.\r\n\r\n**Significant changes**:\r\n- Only allow the trained model to use factor levels actually seen in the developset.  In particular, if the developset and deployset are loaded together from a single file and the deployset contains factor levels not present in the developset, then the developset should forget these additional factor levels.\r\n- Train the fitLogit on the full developset rather than just the trainset.  This is necessary if there are factor levels in the developset which are not in the trainset.  When the factor levels are the same for the trainset and developset, training the fitLogit on a little more data can't hurt (even though the trained model didn't see the testset in training, we can still use the predictions on the testset to understand how the model works).\r\n- Determine whether all factor levels in the developset make it into the train set and warn users about both actual missing levels and also potentially missing factor levels (levels which appear fewer than 4 times have approximately a 1% chance of not making it into the training data).\r\n\r\n**Minor changes**:\r\n- ~~Made the warning message concerning imputation of new factor levels in the test data easier to read .  This solves #485.~~\r\n- ~~Reorganized code in formatFactorColumns to set factors after imputation of NAs introduced by removing new factor levels.~~ \r\n(These changes were also done in yannick481 which has already been merged)\r\n\r\n**Code cleanup**:\r\n- Moved fitGeneralizedLinearModel into the SupervisedModelDevelopment class (removing it from lasso, random forest, and LMM)\r\n- Removed prepareDataForVarImp from LassoDeployment.  This function is no longer needed, having previously been split into two smaller functions and moved to SupervisedModelDeployment.\r\n\r\n**Checks**\r\n\r\nPlease \r\n- [ ] Think about fitting the fitLogit to the full developset rather than just the trainset introduces new problems that I didn't consider.\r\n- [x] Let me know if the warnings about rare factor levels in the developset seem useful or confusing: are both needed?\r\n- [ ] Check that xgboost still works alright when the trained model is forced to forget factor levels not found in the developset (lines 188-197 of supervised model development).  In particular, I'm hoping the problems detailed in #491 haven't been exacerbated.\r\n\r\nI did most of the debugging with the diabetes data set Ethan is using for his notebook which has many infrequently occurring factor levels, but is large and requires some cleaning.  A simpler data set exhibiting some of the same features can be constructed as follows:\r\n```\r\nset.seed(1492)\r\n# Build toy data set for many infrequently occurring factor levels\r\n# 30 factor levels spread over 100 data points for both variables\r\nn = 100\r\nheights = as.character(1:30)\r\nwidths = as.character(1:30)\r\ndf <- data.frame(id = 1:n,\r\n                 height = sample(heights, n, replace = TRUE),\r\n                 width = sample(widths, n, replace = TRUE))\r\n# Add response variable\r\ndf['large'] <- ifelse(as.numeric(df$height) + as.numeric(df$width) > 35, 'Y', 'N')\r\n```",

        "body": "This is kind of a big PR. A lot of files changed. Here's an **overview** of what happened:\r\n- Anything concerning `InTestWindow` was removed from `SupervisedModelDevelopment`. It now gives a prediction for every row passed to it.\r\n- Fixed a bug where deploy predictions were being generated from non-imputed data.\r\n- Fixed a bug where LMM top factors was calculated based on PatientID. This is what caused the `stats: sweep` warning.\r\n- TestWindowCol was removed from CSV, MSSQL, and SQLite. \r\n- Develop examples and tests train on all 1000 rows of sample data\r\n- Deploy examples predict on rows 951:1000 of sample data\r\n- Unit tests were updated to reflect slight changes in generated probabilities following the changed data set.\r\n- Updated docs to reflect changes.\r\n- Removed dplyr and magrittr dependencies (they were handy in xgboost)\r\n\r\n**Known issues:**\r\n- If deploy data does not have all the same levels in a factor column, imputation will be different from development. Has this been fixed in Python?\r\n\r\n**Please do:**\r\n- [x] Run CRAN check for examples and unit tests.\r\n- [ ] Run examples in a script window and ensure that they read correctly.\r\n- [ ] Read through `compare.md` and `deploy.md` to make sure they are reasonable.\r\n\r\nThanks!! I have a lot of free time \ud83d\ude44 to help with questions.",

Now are built from CSV by travis_tool.sh\r\n1. LMM and other long running examples were shortened. Resolved #177  \r\n2. SQL examples were changed to /donttest so that they are not tested by travis or appveyor to prepare for #109 \r\n3. Added travis.yml and configured to build on linux and mac to prepare for #109 \r\n4. Added set seed explicitly to several examples to address #184. This also caused unit test failures on Linux and Mac.\r\n5. Removed some RiskAdjustedComparison unit tests that were platform specific. Open issue #203 to fix\r\n\r\nSorry that so much got dragged into this!!",
